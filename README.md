# animatorExample
This is example project of feature,t that was described here: https://twitter.com/rodikovev/status/933038872992329729

1. This example is super simple: open testZone scene and launch it. 
2. You will see white square that moves up and down, select it in hierarchy (Canvas/testImage) and you will see script, called Test Zone, attached to it. This script has 2 sliders: x and y position. 
3. If you will change x position, square will change his x position component, and if you will try to change y position component, it won't affect square, because y component is used by animator.

Created and tested in Unity 5.6.3f1
